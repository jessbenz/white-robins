# white-robins
Version 1.0 
Date 22 Oct 2017

GENERAL USAGE
    - The site is built using Bootstrap (and jQuery) and Sass, so you will need to install Sass and use something to compile it down to css. You can follow the instructions from the Sass site: http://sass-lang.com/guide.

    - The fonts have been included using Adobe's Typekit library. The kit is assigned to the whiterobins.ie domain (if you deploy to a dev site you'll get an error if it's not the same url, but that's ok while developing). I suggest moving the Typekit account over to your name/company. Create an account here: https://typekit.com/ and create a new Kit for White Robins.

Easy-peasy!
